On February 19th, I arrived in Shanghai from Chaohu, Anhui province. I had to carry my heavy suitcase and bag, and due to the luggage security examination, I had to put them on the rolling belt and then put them back on the road, which was vert tiring and troublesome. Luckily, there was not raining cats and dogs on this day, or else it would have been even more difficult.

Leaving home is never easy, but I had to do it to pursue my goals. It took me  almost three hours to get to Shanghai, and while having my meal in the school dining hall, I couldn't help but miss the meals my family used to prepare for me.

Despite the difficulties, I'm determined to study hard and improve my skills this semester. Let's do this.
