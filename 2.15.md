Today, I woke up at 7:00 am, which marks the beginning of my effort to sleep and wake up early, a healthy habit I wish to develop. Although I'm just a beginner, I hope I can continue to maintain this habit.

Next, I spent almost an hour and a half watching videos about CSAPP in preparation for my upcoming exams. During the review, I realized that computers are absolutely greatest inventions in human history, and there are so many interesting things to learn. However, the process can be tiring, and I find it difficult to focus on CSAPP for more than two hours at a time, which is a problem for me.

Aside from learning CSAPP, I also learned about MyBatis, a framework for interacting with databases, which I need for my project. However, I still have a long way to go with my project.

At 10:00 pm, I tutored my younger sister in math. Her foundational understanding is weak, and while I tried to teach her patiently, she did not seem to understand anything I was explaining. I gradually became impatient. She only has four months left before she participates in the Senior School Entrance Test, and I feel worried about her progress.
