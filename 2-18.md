I come back. 

Although I didn't write the daily routine of recent days, I still keep learning English. But writing is a troublesome process, and I think it difficult to keep on. I have failed to do on February 16th, 17th. But I will try my best to cultivate this writing habit.

==I'm back. Even though I didn't write about my daily routine for the past few days, I'm still committed to learning English. Writing, however, is a difficult process, and I find it hard to keep up with it. I missed writing on February 16th and 17th, but I'll do my best to cultivate this writing habit.==

Today, I watched the video which teach how to think in English. It is clearly known for me that I always try to translate English to Chinese while listening to English. The translation process is really time-consuming. Only by developing an English mind can I solve my English Listening problem radically. What I learned from the video is below.

==Today, I watched the video that teaches how to think in English. I realized that I always try to translate English into Chinese while listening to English, which is a time-consuming process. The only way to overcome this problem is to develop an English mindset. Here's what I learned from the video.==

1. first, take a moment as you're naming objects to think about pronunciation. 

> I tried this method. But there are so many objects in my life. I can only said a little of them. This is a tough process. But I believe this method is helpful. Like when we are young, we learned to speak by listening to the how the people beside ourselves name objects. This is the way we gradually learned to speak in our native language.

> ==I tried this method. But there are so many objects in my life that it's challenging to name all of them. However, I believe that this method is helpful. It's similar to how we learned out native language by listening to people around us name objects.==

2. Think in sample sentences.

> This approach is that let me describe our life stage. For example, my computer is on the desk. After learning for serval years, I always feel tired.
>
> Just like those.
>
> ==This approach involves describing various aspects of daily life. For example, "my computer is on the desk", or "I'm feeling tired after studying for serval hours."==

3. Have small conversations with yourself in English

> Take a few minutes every day to chat with myself. The topic can be daily routine. Just like what I am writing. hah.
>
> ==Take a few minutes every day to chat with yourself in English. You can talk about you daily routine, for example, which is similar to what I'm doing right now.hah==

4. Change one of your everyday life things to English

> Oh no. I forgot this method which is used to think in English. I will watch the video again later.
>
> ==Oh, no. I forgot this method, which helps to think in English. I'll watch the video again later to learn more about it.==

5. keep track so you're doing it every day.

> Just try to think in English. For example, when you ride a bike, you are supposed to describe this process in English.
>
> ==Try to think in English while doing your everyday activities. For example, describe the process of riding a bike in English.==

6. recap your day in English

> This is what I am doing. From this view of point, it seems that I know how to think in  English. 
>
> ==This is what I'm doing right now. From this perspective, it seems like I'm making progress in thinking in English.==
